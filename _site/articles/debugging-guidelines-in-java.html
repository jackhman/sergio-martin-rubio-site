<p>Debugging is a tool mostly use when an application is not behaving as expected, and every developer should learn how to use it. However, it requires a lot of time to master it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <strong>Java</strong> provides some tools part of <strong>JDK</strong> (jstack…), and there also third party tools, such as <a href="https://jmeter.apache.org/"><strong>JMeter</strong></a>, that can help us. There is also a very good integration with IDEs such as <strong>IntelliJ</strong> or <strong>Eclipse</strong>, so it is very important to know how to use the debugging features of our favourite IDE.</p>

<p>In order to speed up this learning process we can follow these guidelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not be afraid of reading code, specially if the code is from others. We should go as deep as we can to understand what is really happening under the hood.</li>
  <li>Do not blame <strong>JDK</strong> or libraries. Never assume that <strong>Java</strong> is broken, because probabilities are always against you. 99% of the times the bug is on something you coded.</li>
  <li>Make assumptions, but do not trust yourself, because we might create blind spots.</li>
  <li>Walk away from the problem and come back when you are fresh (work out, go to bed, meet your friends…).</li>
  <li>Do not program by coincidence, or in other words, do not try stuff without knowing what you are doing.</li>
  <li>Google is your best coding friend.</li>
  <li>Check JDK <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html">javadoc</a> when you are not sure about how a <strong>Java</strong> feature works.</li>
  <li>Use proper log levels (info, warn, error, debug).</li>
  <li>Use breakpoints to have a full view of the program on a particular point of our application. Conditions on breakpoints are also very useful when we are debugging a loop with thousands of values.</li>
  <li>Use tools such as <strong>JMeter</strong> for load testing or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstack.html">jstack</a> to capture thread dumps.</li>
  <li>Have a remote debugger for your applications deployed on dev and pre-production environments.</li>
  <li>If we are not able to find the source of the issue by any of the previous guidelines; firstly, start eliminating code; secondly, check your environment; and thirdly, check libraries.</li>
</ol>

<p>Debugging is an art hard to master, and will definitely require a few years of experience, so start building your debugging skills as soon as possible!</p>
