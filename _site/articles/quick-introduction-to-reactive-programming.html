<p><strong>Reactive programming</strong> is based on async and non blocking threads, so that, it allows us to use efficiently all the needed threads.</p>

<p>This paradigm makes use of the <strong>Publisher-Subscriber</strong> pattern to achieve asynchronous and event-based sequences of data.</p>

<h2 id="operators">Operators</h2>
<p>Operators are like the operations offered by the <strong>Stream API</strong> introduced in <strong>Java 8</strong>, this means that they do not get executed until a terminal operation is invoked, so that nothing happens until you subscribe. There are two operators:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Flux&lt;T&gt;</code>: for 0 to N elements</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Mono&lt;T&gt;</code>: for 0 or 1 element.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two operators allows us to use similar operations as the ones provided by the Stream API (<code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">flatMap</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">range…</code>), and eventually they will consumed when <code class="highlighter-rouge">subscribe()</code> is called.</p>

<p>## Other features</p>

<p>The <a href="https://projectreactor.io/"><strong>Reactor API</strong></a> also allows other kind of operations like schedules, publish on a particular thread the subsequence operations (<code class="highlighter-rouge">publishOn()</code>) or subscribe all the previous operations on a specific thread (<code class="highlighter-rouge">subscribeOn()</code>)</p>

<p>Moreover, <strong>Reactor 3</strong> is fully integrated with <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2017/09/28/spring-framework-5-0-goes-ga"><strong>Spring 5</strong></a>, and can by used through the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html">Spring WebFlux</a> framework, so you can create reactive routings. In order to fully make use of the reactive paradigm we will have to use reactive Spring Data and <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty">reactor-netty</a> which is built on Netty to provide reactive I/O.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>This library also provides some testing features. <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/test/release/api/reactor/test/StepVerifier.html">StepVerifier</a> allows us to simulate a reactive chain of operations, and finally call <code class="highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> as the terminal operation, otherwise, <code class="highlighter-rouge">StepVerifier</code> will not subscribe to our sequence and nothing will be asserted.</p>

<p>We can also simulate delays by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">withVirtualTime()</code>. This method takes a supplier as input, and lazily creates an instance of the tested <code class="highlighter-rouge">Flux</code>.</p>

<p>Another testing tool is <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/test/release/api/reactor/test/publisher/TestPublisher.html">TestPublisher</a>, which allows us to trigger <code class="highlighter-rouge">onNext</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">onComplete</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">onError</code> events.</p>

<p>## Challenges</p>

<ul>
  <li>Debugging: if a error is raised it will only show where the subscription happend, and we will not know where to start debugging. We might need to use debug sessions on our IDE, logs, execute operators on different threads, checkpoints…</li>
  <li>The complexity of our code might increase.</li>
  <li>More memory intensive.</li>
</ul>
